This is a random password generator based on a pre-built HTML page styled with CSS and limited guidance as how to to set up the .js

Please note the following functionalities:

- Upon pressing Generate Password, the user will be prompted to select from criteria to determine the possible content of the password
- Once the user has pressed OK to confirm the final choice, the password will be displayed within the Generate a Password box, overwriting the placeholder "Your Secure Password" text.
- The password will stay on screen until a new password is fully generated.
- If the user enters an invalid choice on the length selection screen, appropriate prompts will appear to ensure a number between 8 and 128 is entered before proceeding.
- If the user wishes to exit the wizard, they may type different iterations of "exit" into the length prompt field and press OK.
- If the user does not press OK for any of the secondary options, the generator will prompt the user to select at least one criteria.
